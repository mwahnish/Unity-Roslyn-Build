# .NET Compiler Platform ("Roslyn") For Unity
This project aims to create a compiled version of the [Roslyn compiler platform](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) ready to use in the [Unity Game Engine](https://unity.com/). The Roslyn library provides users APIs to access C# and Visual Basic compilers and code analysis features. In Unity, this is particularly useful for creating in-game scripting tools.

The following Roslyn packages are currently available through this project:
* Microsoft.Net.Compilers
* Microsoft.CodeAnalysis
* Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Features

## Using this project
To use this project, download the Unity package from the [releases page.](https://github.com/mwahnish/Unity-Roslyn/releases). Compatibility has been tested for the following platforms:
* Unity 2018.1 Editor
* Unity 2019.1 Editor
